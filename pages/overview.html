<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this tutorial, we will cover communicating with an Arduino UNO from a web
  browser, using the JavaScript runtime environment
  <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>. An overview of how
  this system will work is shown below in Figure 1.

  In the browser there will be a form with a couple of inputs. When the form is
  submittted, the input values will be sent to a server via a socket. The server
  will then read the data and send it on to the Arduino over the serial (USB)
  port. On the Arduino there will be a program that repeatedly checks the serial
  port for data - when it arrives, the program reads it and does something with
  it, (blinking an LED in this case).

  We will start by covering what hardware and software is required, followed by
  going over installation of Node.js, Node socket and serial port modules, and
  the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Next, we will cover
  writing the client HTML and JavaScript, writing the server (also in
  JavaScript), and the Arduino program. We will conclude with wiring up the
  Arduino circuit and running the example.
